# A Web Component with Auto-Resizing Font based on Text Length
[https://codepen.io/6chinwei/pen/WbeQNKp](https://codepen.io/6chinwei/pen/WbeQNKp)


A custom web component `<hello-card>` that automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text based on the content of the `name` attribute. The more text you provide, the smaller the font size becomes, ensuring that the text always fits in a single line on the card. This is implemented using `scrollWidth` to determine the elementâ€™s width for dynamic font resizing.
